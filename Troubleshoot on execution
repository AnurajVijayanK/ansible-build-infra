If you're looking to test new plays or do some debugging, there are a few alternative ways to run playbooks in Ansible. Using these switches can help you catch problems in your code more quickly. Here is a breakdown of a few:

-vvvv enables connection debugging.
--step causes Ansible to stop on each task and ask if it should execute that task.
--check enables check mode, where Ansible runs without making any changes on remote systems.
--diff enables diff mode, where Ansible provides before-and-after comparisons.
--start-at-task starts executing your playbook at a particular task.
